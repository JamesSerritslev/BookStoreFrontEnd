# Loading Indicators & Error Handling Improvements

## 🎯 Overview

## ✅ Completed Improvements

### 1. **Global Toast Notification System**

- ✅ Available globally throughout the application
- ✅ Supports success and error variants

**File:** `app/layout.tsx`

```typescript
import { Toaster } from "@/components/ui/toaster";
// ... added to layout
<Toaster />;
```

### 2. **Shop Page Loading & Cart Feedback**

**File:** `components/ShopContent.tsx`

#### **Features Added:**

- ✅ **Initial Loading State**: Shows spinner while books are being loaded from API
- ✅ **Add to Cart Loading**: Individual button loading states with spinner
- ✅ **Success Toast**: Displays success message when item is added to cart
- ✅ **Error Toast**: Shows error if cart operation fails

#### **User Experience:**

1. **Page Load**: Users see a loading spinner with "Loading books..." message
2. **Add to Cart**: Button shows spinner and "Adding..." text during operation
3. **Success Feedback**: Green toast notification confirms item was added
4. **Error Handling**: Red toast notification if something goes wrong

**Code Example:**

```typescript
const handleAddToCart = async (bookId: number, bookTitle: string) => {
  setAddingToCart(bookId);
  try {
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500)); // API call
    toast({
      title: "Added to cart!",
      description: `"${bookTitle}" has been added to your cart.`,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    toast({
      title: "Error",
      description: "Failed to add item to cart.",
      variant: "destructive",
    });
  } finally {
    setAddingToCart(null);
  }
};
```

   - Submit button shows spinner and "Adding..." or "Updating..." text
   - Success toast confirms the operation
2. **Deleting Books**:

   - Delete button shows spinner and "Deleting..." text
   - Success toast confirms deletion
   - Other buttons remain functional

3. **Cancel Edit**:
   - New "Cancel Edit" button to exit edit mode easily

```typescript
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  setIsSubmitting(true);
  try {
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 800)); // API call
    if (editingId !== null) {
      // Update book
      toast({
        title: "Book updated!",
        description: `"${title}" has been successfully updated.`,
      });
    } else {
      // Add new book
      toast({
        title: "Book added!",
        description: `"${title}" has been successfully added to the catalog.`,
      });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    toast({
      title: "Error",
      description: "Failed to save book. Please try again.",

};
```

## 🔧 Backend Integration Ready

All loading states and error handling are ready for backend integration:

1. **Replace Mock Delays**:

   ```typescript
   // Replace this:
   await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))

   // With actual API calls:
   const response = await fetch('/api/books', { method: 'POST', ... })
   const data = await response.json()
   ```

2. **Error Handling**: Already catches and displays errors properly

3. **Loading States**: Automatically trigger during async operations

## 🎓 Educational: How It Works

### **1. Toast Notifications:**

The toast system uses React Context to manage a global notification queue. When you call `toast()`, it adds a notification to the queue, which automatically displays and dismisses.

### **2. Loading States:**

Each async operation uses local state (e.g., `isSubmitting`, `addingToCart`) to track loading status. This allows individual components to show spinners independently.

### **3. Error Handling:**

All async operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks, ensuring errors are caught and displayed to the user in a friendly way.
